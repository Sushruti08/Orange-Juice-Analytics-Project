# Orange-Juice-Analytics-Project

The project deals with providing services for the Brand manager and Sales manager of a grocery store specific to their Minute Maid (MM) and Citrus Hill (CH) Orange Juice. Objective of this project is to determine what variables influence a personâ€™s probability of buying MM, on basis of that design the model which predict the probability customer buying the MM. 

We used a logistic regression model with the five independent variables to determine the variables that influence sales of MM. We used a linear kernel, specifically an svmLinear to provide a predictive model to determine probability of buying MM. Since the sales manager is not interested in the particular variables that influence the purchase, we do not need to use a regression model.
